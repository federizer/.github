Federizer focuses on the innovative use of authentication and authorization technologies in open networks in conformance with the [NIST Special Publication 800-63C](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63c.html), Digital Identity Guidelines: Federation and Assertions. We introduce a new API protection mechanism through the [Identity Propagation and Assertions](https://github.com/federizer/identity-propagation-and-assertions) concept. This mechanism is beneficial in the email system to protect MTA-to-MTA communication.

As a proof of concept, we developed [Fedemail](https://github.com/federizer/fedemail) — a revised email system. This email system uses a gRPC message transfer agent (MTA) to transfer arbitrary messages from one computer to another using the gRPC framework. The MTA uses a client authentication mechanism — [mTLS certificate-bound access tokens issued by the Security Token Service (STS)](https://github.com/fedemail/identity-propagation-and-assertions) — to convey the user's security context alongside messages across security boundaries.
